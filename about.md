> “The hardest thing to do is something that is close to nothing.”  -- Marina Abramovic

I need somewhere to put my notes (aka my working memory), not scribbled on pieces of paper that have fallen behind my desk. I am bad, like really bad, at remembering stuff; things I have to do, things I have done, birthdays, childrens performances. 

Please take my working memory with a punch of salt (ha, I meant pinch, but am sticking with punch), whatever I write here might be inspirational, or factually inaccurate, or both, but mostly neither.

So, about me.  I am a performance engineer, currently working for Red Hat (by IBM).  So what does a performance engineer do?  As close to nothing as possible whilst remaining fully functional.  This is both an art and a skill, honed over years of living by the mantra “Never waste any time you can spend sleeping.” 

Obviously I am talking about sofware efficiency and sleeping cpu cycles ;-)
